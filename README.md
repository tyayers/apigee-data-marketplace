# Apigee Data Marketplace
This project uses the Google Cloud Apigee and Application Integration services to offer a holistic data marketplace on top of data lakes, databases, and any other data-related assets, along with other APIs and services.

This approach has the advantage that unified identity, access management, integration flows, monetization and security policies make it possible to truly offer a unified marketplace for data assets in an organization.
